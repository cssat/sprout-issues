# The Sprout Issue Repository

Please take a moment to review this document in order to make the process of 
raising Sprout issues easy and effective for everyone involved.

Following these guidelines helps to communicate that you respect the time of
the team managing and developing Sprout. In return, the Sprout team will reciprocate 
that respect in addressing your issue or assessing new feature requests.

## Using the issue tracker

The issue tracker is the preferred channel for [bug reports](#bugs),
[features requests](#features), but please respect the following restrictions:

* Please **do not** use the issue tracker for personal support requests (use
  the [Sprout Support Center](https://support.oliverservices.org/hc/en-us/requests/new)).

* Please **do not** derail or troll issues. Keep the discussion on topic and
  respect the opinions of others.

## Bug reports

A bug is a _demonstrable problem_ that is caused by the code in the repository.
Good bug reports are extremely helpful - thank you!

Guidelines for bug reports:

1. **Use the GitHub issue search** &mdash; check if the issue has already been
   reported.

2. **Provide a Reproducible Example** &mdash; try to reproduce the bug using screenshots and 
   specific information from [Usertest](https://usertest.sproutservices.org). DO NOT PUT 
   PII ON THE ISSUE TRACKER. 

A good bug report shouldn't leave others needing to chase you up for more
information. Please try to be as detailed as possible in your report. What steps 
will reproduce the issue? What browser(s) and OS experience the problem? What would 
you expect to be the outcome? All these details will help people to fix any potential bugs.

Example:

> Short and descriptive example bug report title
>
> A summary of the issue and the browser/OS environment in which it occurs. If
> suitable, include the steps required to reproduce the bug.
>
> 1. This is the first step
> 2. This is the second step
> 3. Further steps, etc.
>
> `<url>` - a link to the sprout URL in which the bug is taking place. 
>
> Any other information you want to share that is relevant to the issue being
> reported.

## Feature requests

Feature requests are welcome. But take a moment to find out whether your idea
fits with the scope and aims of the project. It's up to *you* to make a strong
case to convince the Sprout team of the merits of this feature. Please
provide as much detail and context as possible.
